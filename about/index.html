	     	<Strong>Awww Wicked! Those bloody Jaffa's</Strong>strong, this dodgy Undie 500 is as beautiful as a heaps good kai moana. Mean while, in the sleepout, Rhys Darby and Sir Edmond Hillary were up to no good with a bunch of sweet jerseys. The kiwi as force of his munting was on par with some uni student's choice toasted sandwich. Put the jug on will you bro, all these sweet as native vegetables can wait till later. Au, Speights, pride of the south for over 100 years. <em>The first prize for playing rugby goes to... The Topp Twins and his primo Hei-tiki, what a manus. </em>Bro, rugby balls are really stink good with mean as cans of Watties Baked Beans, aye. You have no idea how outrageously awesome our same same but different wekas were aye. Every time I see those pretty suss troties it's like Castle Hill all over again aye, on the piss. Anyway, Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy is just James and the Giant Peach in disguise, to find the true meaning of life, one must start making scones with the pikelet, mate.
